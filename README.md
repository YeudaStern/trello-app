This project helps to manage tasks in a smart, easy and orderly way

I used the following technologies:

Next.js 14: To wrap the project in an easy and convenient way.  Next allows to code server side and frontend in the same folder.

Typescript: To avoid problems with tape recorders already at the coding stage and thus avoid errors in the future.

Tailwind: For the design.
I actually used Tailwind because it is a perfect framework for a comfortable design that is easy to understand and use.

Clerk: To manage users in an easy way.  clerk they prepare the code and give you a ready kit to manage your users.
